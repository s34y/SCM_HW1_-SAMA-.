configuration management (CM) is very important in software development.
It avoids disputes among team members, enables the duplication of any revision of the program, and assists in determining who made every modification and why.
CM helps teams to rapidly recover from mistakes by providing stable versions, therefore lowering integration issues and supporting trustworthy releases.
It generally increases traceability, quality, cooperation, and the software development cycle’s stability.
